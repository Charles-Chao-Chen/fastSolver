- Launch node tasks are given negative mapping tags to be differentiate
   from normal tasks. So use abs(task->tag) to select memroy and 
   set virtual_map field in map_task().

- Define DEBUG in makefile to serialize task execution for debuging
purpose.

- The number of tasks: Consider the balanced binary tree. 
When the number of legion leaf is N, there are log_2(N) levels.
(1) leaf solve happens N times
(2) LU node solve happens on every node except the legion leaves, so there are N-1 of them
(3) broadcast happens at every node, so it is N log_2(N)
(4) reduce needs to be done for d and U, so twice as many as broadcast, i.e. 2N log_2(N)
Above all, there are 3N log_2(N) + 2N -1 tasks in the solver.

- Breadth-first traversal is crucial in this case. Consider runing on two nodes, tasks on node 1 always start later than those on node 0 using depth-first traversal, which can cause a huge delay (e.g. 128 legion leaves).
